## Project Code
### MSP, Jan-Nov 2020

This repository contains the code explicitly used in 
1. Petersen & Penarrubia (2020a)
2. Petersen & Penarrubia (2020b)
3. Lots of easter eggs generated for referee reports

Multinest chains are available, but the multinest code and inputs are
found elsewhere: contact if interested.

Data tables are located in processed/*heliocentric_sgr.txt for satellites, BHBs, and K Giants. 

Most notebooks are frozen as-is; please contact me if you have anything specific you are looking for.
